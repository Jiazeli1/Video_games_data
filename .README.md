Hi Kat &Perry

I used the Video Game Sales datasets as my database.  In this datasets you can see nearly 17,000 game sales, developers, and other relevant information over the last four decades. I made a classification that lets you type in the name of a game and get the name of its publisher. 

First I imported the datasets and Identify its path. Then I tested the datasets' name, genre and publisher. I decided to use the 'name' as the feature and use the 'publisher' as the labels. The number of unique labels are 579, I think it's enough for me to classify.

I then used the zip function to match the name and publisher so that each game name would be followed by its corresponding publisher.

After calculating the number of all features, I trained them in a ratio of two to eight. I then did a lot of testing, and I could retrieve the publisher for each game's name. However, the accuracy rate given by the system is only 0.27.



*How to improve*

If I could improve it further, I would like to improve the accuracy of the data, and I would also like to add more complex functions, such as searching for which company has developed the most games in a given period, or which game company has the highest revenue, or the consumer trends of the Japanese market over the past 40 years.

Thank you very much
